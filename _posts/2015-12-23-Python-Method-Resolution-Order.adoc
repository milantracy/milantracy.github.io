= Python Method Resolution Order
:hp-tags: Python, Inherirance

In languages that use multiple inheritance, the order in which base classes are searched when looking for a method is often called the *Method Resolution Order* or *MRO*, in Python, it also applies to other attributes.

Python has known at least three different MRO algorithms, classic, Python 2.2 style, C3 and Python3.

### Classic
Classic classes used a simple MRO scheme: when Python looks for a method or a attribute, base classes wewe searched using a simple *depth-first* and *left-to-right*(defined in the subclass) scheme. The first matching obejct found during this search would be returned.

For example, we have following code:
```python
class A:
  def test(self): pass


class B(A):
  pass
  
class C:
  def test(self):
    pass
    
class D(B, C): pass
```

If we create an instance of class D, the classic method resolution order would be D, B, A, C. Thus, a search for the method _test_ () would produce A.test(). In this example, when python find method _test_ () in the class A, it will be retuened and run immeadiately, class C won't be searched.

### New Style
All new style classes would be defined by inheriting from a base class *object*.

Thus, any use of *multiple inheritance* in new style classes would always create the diamond realtionship. Since object defined a number of methods that are sometimes extended by subtypes, the resolution order is critical. 

In Python 2.2, a MRO scheme is that the MRO would be *pre-computed* when a class was defined and *stored as an attribute* of eah class object.

In Python 2.2, the basic MRO would be *depth first, left to right* traversal of the classes as before, if any clas was duplicated in the search, all but the last occurence would be deleted from the MRO list. For exampe,
```python
class A(object):
  def test(): pass
  
class B(A):
  pass
  
class C(A):
  def test(): pass
  
  
class D(B, C):
  pass
```
In the above code, the MRO was supposed to be D, B, A, C, A, however, with new style MRO, all duplcates would be removed except the last one, the actual resolution order is D, B, C, A.

In reality, the computation of the MRO was more complex than the previous two examples.

For more complex situation, the MRO algorithm tried to preserve the order of classes fro bases that appeard first in the search process. For example,
```python
class A(object): pass
class B(object): pass
class C(A, B): pass
class D(B, A): pass
class E(C, D): pass
```
In the above code, with MRO in python 2.2, the order is E, C, D, B, A after removing dupcates from ECABDBA.

The algorithm tried to preserve the order of classes for bases that appeared first in the search process because it was first in the inheritance list. In this example, sicne A is first in the inheritance list, the MRO algorithm would try to preserve that orderin. Thus, the final ordering of the MRO algorithm goes to E, C, D, A, B.


Specifically, if a class A inherits from class B, then the MRO should obviously check A before B. Likewise, if a class B uses multiple inheritance to inherit from C and D. then B should be checked before C and ould be checked before D.


#### C3

C3 MRO is all about _new style_ classes, it folliws the old method resolution ordre, depth first and left to right. Therefore, there is no breaking of old code for classic classes.

With a complex inheritance hierarchy, you want to be able to satisfy all of these possible rules in a way that is monotonic, that is, if you have already determinied that class A should be checked before class B, then you should never encounter a situation that requires class B to be checked before class A, otherwise, the resule is undefined and the inheritance hierachy should be rejected.


Basically, the idea behind C3 is that if you write down all of the ordering rules imposed by inheritance relationships in a complex class hierarchy, the algorithm will determine a monotonic ordering of the classes that satisfies all of them.


MRO algorithm in Pythonn 2.2 was abandon in 2.3, one outcome of this is that python will now reject any inheritance hierarchy that has an inconsistent ordering of base classes.


In the last example, there is an ordering conflict between class C and class D. For class C, there is a rule that says class A should be checked before class B, however, for class D, the rule says that class B should be checked before class A. 

In isolation, this discrepancy is fine, but if C and D are ever combined together in the same inheritance hierarchy for another class, that class will be rejected by C3 MRO algorithm.
