= Python Method Resolution Order
:hp-tags: Python, Inherirance

In languages that use multiple inheritance, the order in which base classes are searched when looking for a method is often called the *Method Resolution Order* or *MRO*, in Python, it also applies to other attributes.

Python has known at least three different MRO algorithms, classic, Python 2.2 style, C3 and Python3.

### Classic
Classic classes used a simple MRO scheme: when Python looks for a method or a attribute, base classes wewe searched using a simple *depth-first* and *left-to-right*(defined in the subclass) scheme. The first matching obejct found during this search would be returned.

For example, we have following code:
```python
class A:
  def test(self): pass


class B(A):
  pass
  
class C:
  def test(self):
    pass
    
class D(B, C): pass
```

If we create an instance of class D, the classic method resolution order would be D, B, A, C. Thus, a search for the method _test_ () would produce A.test(). In this example, C won't be searched since once they find _test_ () function in class A, the method defined in class A is returned and run immediately.

### New Style
All new style classes would be defined by inheriting from a base class *object*. Thus, any use of multiple inheritance in new style classes would always create the diamond realtionship. Since object defined a number of methods that are sometimes extended by subtypes, the resolution order is critical. 

In Python 2.2, a MRO scheme is that the MRO would be *pre-computed* when a class was defined and *stored as an attribute* of eah class object.

The computation of the MRO was officially socumented as using a *depth-first, left to right* traversal of the classes as before. If an y class was *duplicated* in the dearch, all but the last occurence would be deleted from the MRO list. For example,
```python
class A(obejct):
	def test(): pass
    
class B(A):
	pass
    
class C(A):
	def test(): pass

class D(B, C):
	pass
```

With the above code, if we adopt classic classes, the seach order would be D, B, A, C, A, with new style, dupliated class will be deleted except the last occurrence, the actual MRO goes to D, B, C, A.
