= Garbage Collection

#### What is Automatic Garbage Collection?
Automatic garbage collection is the process of looking at *heap* memory, identifying which objects are in use and which are not, and deleting the unused objects. So the memory used by an unreferenced object can be *reclaimed*.

* An *in use object*, or *a referenced object*, means that some part of your program still maintains a pointer to that object. 
* *An unused object*, or *unreferenced object*, is no longer referenced by any part of your program.

In Java, process of deallocating memory is handled automatically by the *garbage collector*. The basic process can be described as follows.

* Marking

- This is where the garbage collector identifies which pieces of memory are in use and which are not. All objects are scanned in the marking phase to make this determination. This can be a very *time consuming* process if all objects in a system must be scanned.

* Normal Deletion

Normal deletion removes *unreferenced objects* leaving referenced objects and pointers to free space. The memory allocator holds references to blocks of free space where new object can be allocated.

* Deletion with Compacting
To further improve performance, in addition to deleting unreferenced objects, you can also compact the remaining referenced objects. By moving referenced object together, this makes new memory allocation much easier and faster.

#### Generational Garbage Collection?
As stated earlier, having to mark and compact all the objects in a JVM is inefficient. As more and more objects are allocated, the list of objects grows and grows leading to longer and longer garbage collection time. However, empirical analysis of applications has shown that *most objects are short lived*.

The heap is broken up into smaller parts or generations.

1. *Young Generation*
* The Young Generation is where all *new objects are allocated and aged*. When the young generation fills up, this causes a *minor garbage collection*. Minor collections can be optimized assuming a high object mortality rate. A young generation full of dead objects is collected very quickly. Some surviving objects are aged and eventually move to the old generation.
2. *Old or Tenured Generation*
* The *Old Generation* is used to store *long surviving objects*. Typically, a threshold is set for young generation object and when that age is met, the object gets moved to the old generation. Eventually the old generation needs to be collected when the old generation fills up. This event is called a *major garbage collection*.
3. *Permanent Generation*.
* The *Permanent generation* contains metadata required by the JVM to describe the classes and methods used in the application. The permanent generation is populated by the JVM at runtime based on classes in use by the application. In addition, Java SE library classes and methods may be stored here.
* Classes may get collected (unloaded) if the JVM finds they are no longer needed and space may be needed for other classes. The permanent generation is included in a *full garbage collection*.

*Stop the World Event* - All *minor garbage collections* are "Stop the World" events. This means that all application threads are stopped until the operation completes. Minor garbage collections are always Stop the World events.

*Major garbage collection* are also *Stop the World events*. Often a major collection is much slower because it *involves all live objects*. Major garbage collections should be minimized.



### Generational Garbage Collection

* First, any new objects are allocated to the *eden space*. Both survivor spaces start out empty.

* When the eden space fills up, a *minor garbage collection* is triggered.

* Referenced objects are moved to the first *survivor space*. Unreferenced objects are deleted when the eden space is cleared.

* At the next minor GC, the same thing happens for the eden space. Unreferenced objects are deleted and referenced objects are moved to a survivor space. However, in this case, they are moved to the second survivor space (S1). In addition, *objects from the last minor GC* on the first survivor space (S0) have their *age incremented* and get moved to S1. Once all surviving objects have been moved to S1, both *S0 and eden* are cleared. Notice we now have differently aged object in the survivor space.

* At the next minor GC, the same process repeats. However this time the survivor spaces switch. Referenced objects are moved to S0. Surviving objects are aged. Eden and S1 are cleared.

* After a minor GC, when aged objects reach a *certain age threshold* (8 in this example) they are promoted from young generation to old generation.
