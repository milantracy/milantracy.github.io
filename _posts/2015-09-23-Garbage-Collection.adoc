#### What is Automatic Garbage Collection?
Automatic garbage collection is the process of looking at *heap* memory, identifying which objects are in use and which are not, and deleting the unused objects. So the memory used by an unreferenced object can be *reclaimed*.

* An *in use object*, or *a referenced object*, means that some part of your program still maintains a pointer to that object. 
* *An unused object*, or *unreferenced object*, is no longer referenced by any part of your program.

In Java, process of deallocating memory is handled automatically by the *garbage collector*. The basic process can be described as follows.

1. Marking

* This is where the garbage collector identifies which pieces of memory are in use and which are not. All objects are scanned in the marking phase to make this determination. This can be a very time consuming process if all objects in a system must be scanned.
