= Sort Algorithms Summary
:hp-tags: algorithms, sort, Java

A simple summary for sorting algorithms I learned in college and free time. The article will cover the basic idea, algorigm analysis, stability.

A sorting algorithm is said to be *stable* if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input unsorted array.

### Insertion Sort
1. Basic Idea
* The array is divided into two parts, the first part is sorted starting with an *empty set*, the second part is identical to the original array
* Every time choose an element from the unsorted part, inser the element into the sorted part.

2. Algorithm Analysis
* Time Complexity
- Best case O(n) for a sorted array
- Worst case O(n^2) for a reverse array 
- Avarage ase O(n^2)
* Space Complexity
- O(1)

3. Stability
If two element has same value, the posterior one would insert after the element with the same value.
So insertion sort algorithm is stable.

4. Code in Java
```java
public void insertionSort(int[] nums){
  if(nums == null || nums.length < 2)
    return;
  for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
    int key = nums[i];
    int j = i;
    for(;j > 0 && key < nums[j - 1]; j--)
      nums[j] = nums[j - 1];
    nums[j] = key;
  }
}
```
