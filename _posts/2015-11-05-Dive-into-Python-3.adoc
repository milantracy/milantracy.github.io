*Function declaration*

Python functions do not specify the datatype of their return value, they don't even specify whether they return a value.

In fact, every Python function *returns a value*, if the function ever executes a return statement, it will return that value; otherwise, it will return *None*, the Python null value.

In Python, *variables* are never explicitly typed, which is also dynamic typed, Python figures out what type a variable is and keeps track of the datatype internally.

*Optional and Named Arguments*
