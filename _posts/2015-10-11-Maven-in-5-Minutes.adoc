= Maven in 5 Minutes
:hp-tags: Maven, Java

#### Installation
Install by *homebrew* on Mac OS or *apt-get* on Ubuntu

Make sure I install maven correctly by:
```
mvn --version
```

#### Creating a Project
You will need somewhere for your project to reside, create a directory somewhere and start a shell in that directory. On your command line, execute the following Maven goal:

```
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=io.github.milantracy -DartifactId=my_app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

mvn would generate a folder named _my_app_, inside the directory, the structure would be maven [standard project structure](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html)
