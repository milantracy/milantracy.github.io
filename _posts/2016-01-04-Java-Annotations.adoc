= Java Annotations
:hp-tags: Java





*Annotations* are a form of metadata that provides data about a progarm that is not part of the program itself. Annotation have no direct effect on the operation of the code they annotete.

Annotations are mainly used for:

1. Information for the compiler, it can be used by the compiler to *detect errors* or *suppress warnings*.
2. *Compiler time and deployment processing*. Software tools can process annotation inoformation to generate code, XML files and  so forth.
3. *Runtime process*, some annotations are available to be examined at runtime.

### Basics
The annotation tupe can be one of the types that are defined in the _java.lang._ or _java.lang.annotation_ package of the Java SE API. For example, _Override_ amd _SuppressWarning_ are predifined Java annotations.

It is also possible to define your own annotation type.


Annotations can be applied to declararions: declarations of classes, field, methods and other progarm elements, when used on a declaration, each annotation often appears on its own line.

In Jva 8, annotations can also be applied to the use of types.


### The format of an annotation
The simplest form of an annotation looks like:

 @Entity

The @ indicatesto the compuler that what follows is an annotation, for example, _Override_
```java
void methodToBeOverride() {...}
```

The annotation can include elemetns which can ba named or unnamed, and there are values for those elements:
```java
@Author(
	name = "Jing",
    date = "1/12/2016"
)
class classToBeAnnotate() {...}
```

or

```java
@SuppressWarnings(value = "uncheck")
void myMethod() {...}
```

If there is just *one element* named _value_, the name can be omitted as:
```
```java
@SuppressWarining(check)
void myMethod() {...}
```
If there is *no elements*, then the parenthsese can be omitted, as the annnotate @Override

If is possible to use multiple annotations on the same declaration:
```java
@Author("Jing")
@Ebook
class MyClass{...}
```

If you have several annotation with same type, this is called _repeating annotations_, repeating annotate is allowed in Java 8.

It is possible to define your own annotation type like @Author and @Ebook in the previous examples.


### Predifined Annotation Types

A set of annotation types are predefined in the Java SE API, some annotation types are used by the Java compiler, and some apply to other annotations.

* Annotation Types used by the Java Language
The predefined annotation tpes defined in _java.lang_ are @_Deprecated_, @_Override_, and @SuppressWarnings

- @*Deprecate* annotation indicates that the marked element is deprecated and should no longer be used. The compiler generates a warning whenever a program uses a method, class or field with the @Deprecaetd annotation.

- @*Override* annotation informs the compiler that the element is meant to override an element declared in a superclass, when it is not required to use this annotation when overriding a method, it helps tp prevent errors.

If a method marked with @Override fails to correctly override a method in its superclass, the compiler generates a error.

- @*SuppressWarnings* annotation tells the compiler to supress specific warnings that it would otherwise genrate. For example, a deprecated method is used, and the compiler usually generates a warning, if we use the @SuppressWarning, the annotation causes the warning to be suppressed.
``` java
@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")
void deprecatedMethod(){
	...
}
```


Every *compiler warning* belongs to a category. There are mainly two categories: *deprecation* and *unchecked*.
