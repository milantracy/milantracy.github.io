= Initialization & Cleanup
:hp-tags: Java, Thinking in Java

As the computer revolution progresses, “*unsafe*” programming has become one of the major culprits that makes programming expensive.

Two of these safety issues are _initialization_ and _cleanup_.
	
- Cleanup is a special problem because it’s easy to forget about an element when you’re done with it, since it no longer concerns you. Thus, the resources used by that element are retained and you can easily end up running out of resources (most notably, memory).


##### Guaranteed initialization with the constructor
In Java, the class designer can guarantee initialization of every object by providing a constructor. If a class has a constructor, Java automatically calls that constructor when an object is created, before users can even get their hands on it. So initialization is guaranteed.

The *_name of the constructor_* is the *same* as the _name of the class_. It makes sense that such a method will be called automatically during initialization.

```
Note that the coding style of making the first letter of all methods lowercase does not apply to constructors, since the name of the constructor must match the name of the class exactly.
```
The constructor is an unusual type of method because it has *_no return value_*. This is distinctly different from a void return value, in which the method returns nothing 

```java
class Rock {
      Rock() { // This is the constructor
        System.out.print("Rock ");
      }
}

public class SimpleConstructor{ 
     public static void main(String[] args) {
    	for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        	new Rock();
     }
} /* 
```
Output:
```
Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock
```

##### Method overloading

_Method overloading_ is essential to allow the *same method name* to be used with different *method signiture*.

Each overloaded method must take a *unique list* of argument types. Even differences in the ordering of arguments are sufficient to distinguish two methods, although you don’t normally want to take this approach because it produces difficult-to-maintain code

The JVM doesn’t consider *return type* when differentiating two method, the *method signature* is the only issue.

* Overloading with primitives
- A primitive can be automatically promoted from a smaller type to a larger one, and this can be slightly confusing in combination with overloading.
- If an overloaded method is available that takes an int, it is used. 
- In all other cases, if you have a data type that is smaller than the argument in the method, that data type is promoted.
- If it doesn’t find an exact char match, it is promoted to int.


##### Default constructors
A default constructor (a.k.a. a “no-arg” constructor) is one without arguments that is used to create a “default object.” If you create a class that has no constructors, the compiler will *automatically* create a default constructor for you.

##### The _this_ keyword
The *this* keyword, which can be used only inside a non-static method—produces the reference to the object that the method has been called for.

The this keyword is used only for those special cases in which you need to *explicitly* use the reference to the *current object*. For example, it’s often used in return statements when you want to return the reference to the current object.

The *this* keyword is also useful for passing the current object to another method.

##### Calling constructors from constructors

When you write several constructors for a class, there are times when you’d like to call one constructor from another to avoid duplicating code. You can make such a call by using the *this* keyword.

##### Hiding data field
In the constructor, if the argument of the constructor hide the data field, you may use this to explicitly refer to the data field of the current object.


##### The meaning of _static_

You cannot call non-static methods from inside static methods2 (although the reverse is possible), and you can call a static method for the class itself, without any object. 

It’s as if you’re creating the equivalent of a *global method*. However, global methods are not permitted in Java, and putting the *static* method inside a class allows it access to other *static* methods and to *static* fields.

All objects of the class would share only *one single copy* of the class's static field and static method.

### Cleanup: finalization and garbage collection

Of course, Java has the garbage collector to reclaim the memory of objects that are no longer used. 

Now consider an unusual case: Suppose your object allocates “special” memory without using new. The garbage collector only knows how to release memory allocated with new, so it won’t know how to release the object’s “special” memory. To handle this case, Java provides a method called *_finalize_*( ) that you can define for your class. 

When the garbage collector is ready to release the storage used for your object, it will first call *_finalize_*( ), and only on the next garbage-collection pass will it reclaim the object’s memory.

##### Garbage colletion is different from destructor in C++.
In C++, objects always get destroyed (in a bug-free program), whereas in Java, objects do not always get garbage collected.

1. *Your objects might not get garbage collected.*
2. *Garbage collection is not destruction.*
- If there is some activity that must be performed before you no longer need an object, you must perform that activity yourself.
- for example, if you draw something on screer, if you do nothing, it never gets clean up, if you put some erasing function inside *_finalize()_*, it may be cleaned up when the program needs a garbage collection.


Garbage collection would happen when it nears the point of running out of the memory, if it nevers reach that point, *the resource would be returned to the OS as long as the program exits*. It is a good thing because garbage collection requires *overhead*.


##### Garbage colletion is only about memory
The garbage collector takes care of the release of all object memory regardless of how the object is created.

It would seem that finalize( ) is in place because of the possibility that you’ll do something Clike by allocating memory using a mechanism other than the normal one in Java. This can happen primarily through native methods, which are a way to call non-Java code from Java.

If you want some kind of *cleanup performed other than storage release*, you must still explicitly call an appropriate method in Java, which is the equivalent of a C++ destructor without the convenience.

**You won’t use finalize( ) much**

If you want some kind of cleanup performed other than storage release, you must still *explicitly* call an appropriate method in Java, which is the equivalent of a C++ destructor without the convenience.
```
Remember that neither garbage collection nor finalization is guaranteed. If the JVM isn’t close to running out of memory, then it might not waste time recovering memory through garbage collection.
```

### How a garbage collector works

1. *Reference Counting*
- Each object contains a reference count, every time a reference is attached to the object, increase the reference count, every time the reference goes out of scope or set to be null, decrese the refernece count.
- Small and constant overhead, but it happens throughout the lifetime of the program.
- Can't deal with circularly referenced objects.

2. *Stop and copy*
- This means that—for reasons that will become apparent—the program is first stopped Then, each live object is copied from one heap to another, leaving behind all the garbage. In addition, as the objects are copied into the new heap, they are packed end-to-end, thus compacting the new heap
- requires two heaps
- when there is no need to do garbege collection, stop and copy would still waste time and resource switching back and forth


3. Swap and age

### JIT

A JIT compiler partially or fully converts a program into *native machine code* so that it doesn’t need to be interpreted by the JVM and thus runs much faster. 

1. JIT takes a little more time
2. JIT increases the size of the executable which might cause page, which makes programs slow down.
