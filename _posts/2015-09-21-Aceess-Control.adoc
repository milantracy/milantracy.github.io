= Aceess Control
:hp-tags: Java, Thinking in Java

Java provides access specifiers to allow the library creator to say what is available to the client programmer and what is not. The levels of access control from “most access” to “least access” are *public*, *protected*, *package access* (which has no keyword), and *private*.

There’s still the question of how the components are bundled together into a cohesive library unit. This is controlled with the *package* keyword in Java, and the access specifiers are affected by whether a class is in the same package or in a separate package.

***
### package: the library unit
A *package* contains a group of classes, organized together under a single _namespace_.

When you create a source-code file for Java, it’s commonly called a *_compilation unit_*. Each compilation unit must have a name ending in .java, and inside the compilation unit there can be a public class that must have the same name as the file (including capitalization, but excluding the .java file name extension). There can be *only one public class* in each compilation unit; otherwise, the compiler will complain. If there are additional classes in that compilation unit, *they are hidden from the world outside that package* because they’re not public, and they comprise “support” classes for the main public class.

When you compile a *.java* file, you get an output file for *_each class_* in the .java file.


A _library_ is a group of these class files. Each source file usually has a public class and any number of non-public classes, so there’s one public component for each source file. If you want to say that all these components (each in its own separate .java and .class files) belong together, that’s where the package keyword comes in.

If you use a package statement, it must appear as the *first non-comment* in the file. 

By convention, the first part of the package name is the *reversed Internet domain name of the creator of the class*. Since Internet domain names are guaranteed to be unique, if you follow this convention, your package name will be unique and you’ll never have a name clash. 


##### Collisions
What happens if two libraries are imported via ‘*’ and they include the same names? 
The compiler complains and forces you to be explicit.


##### package caveat
You implicitly specify a directory structure when you give the package a name. The package *_must_* live in the directory indicated by its name, which must be a directory that is searchable starting from the CLASSPATH.

##### The default package
If some files are in the _same directory_ and have _no explicit package name_. Java treats files like this as implicitly part of the “*default package*” for that directory, and thus they provide package access to all the other files in that directory.

### Java Access Specifier

1. Package access
* The default access has *no keyword*, but it is commonly referred to as *package access*.
* It means that all the other classes in *the current package* have access to that member, but to all the classes *outside of this package*, the member appears to be *private*.
* all the classes within a single compilation unit are automatically available to each other via package access.
* Package access allows you to group *related classes* together in a package so that they can easily interact with each other. When you put classes together in a package, thus granting mutual access to their package-access members, you “own” the code in that package.


2. Pubblic acess
* When you use the public keyword, it means that the member declaration that immediately follows *public* is available to everyone, in particular to the client programmer who uses the library. 

3. Private access
* The private keyword means that *no one* can access that member except the class that contains that member, inside methods of that class. Other classes in the same package cannot access private members, so it’s as if you’re even insulating the class against yourself. 
* On the other hand, it’s not unlikely that a package might be created by several people collaborating together, so private allows you to freely change that member without concern that it will affect another class in the same package.
* The *consistent use* of private is very important, especially where multithreading is concerned. 

* Any method that you’re certain is only a “helper” method for that class can be made *private*, to ensure that you don’t accidentally use it elsewhere in the package and thus prohibit yourself from changing or removing the method. Making a method private guarantees that you retain this option.


4. protected access
* If you create a new package and inherit from a class in another package, the only members you have access to are the public members of the original package. (Of course, if you perform the inheritance in the same package, you can manipulate all the members that have package access.) Sometimes the creator of the base class would like to take a particular member and grant access to derived classes but not the world in general. That’s what protected does. protected also gives package access—that is, other classes in the same package may access protected elements.

### Interface and implementation

Wrapping data and methods within classes in combination with implementation hiding is often called *encapsulation*.

Access control puts boundaries within a data type for two important reasons:

1. To establish what the client programmers can and can’t use without worrying users of the library would modify the internal mechanism.

2. To *separate* the interface from the implementation. If the structure is used in a set of programs, but client programmers can’t do anything but send messages to the public interface, then you are free to change anything that’s not public (e.g., package access, protected, or private) without breaking client code.

### Class access

2. The name of the *public* class must exactly match the name of the file containing the compilation unit, including capitalization.

3. It is possible,though not typical,to have a compilation unit with no public class at all.
