= Flask Form and Login
:hp-tags: Flask, Python, Web

Web forms are one of the most basic blocks in web application, it allows users to wrote blog and also logging to the application.

To support web forms, we need *Flask-WTF* extension, which wraps the WTForms project in a way that integrates nicely with Flask application.

Besides, the extension requires a configuration file named *_config.py_*.
```
WTF_CSRF_ENABLED = True
SECRET_KEY = 'xxxxx'
```

* The *WTF_CSRF_ENABLED* setting activates the cross site request forgery prevention which is enabled by default. It makes the applications more secure.
* The *SECRET_KEY* is needed only if CSRF is enabled, and is used to create a cryptographic token that is used to valdate a form.


#### Flask Form
Web forms are represented in Flask-WTF as classes, subclassed from base class *Form*, a form subclass simply defines the fields of the form as class variable.
