= Programming in Scala
:hp-tags: Scala, Data Science

Scala goes further than all other well-known languages in fusing object- oriented and functional programming into a uniform language design.

Scala is an *object-oriented* language in pure form: every value is an object and every operation is a method call. In Scala a *function* is an object.

In addition to being a pure object-oriented language, Scala is also a full-blown *functional language*. 

Functional programming is guided by two main ideas.

1. The first idea is that functions are *first-class values*. 
* In a functional language, a function is a value of the same status as an integer or a string. 
* You can pass functions as arguments to other functions, return them as results from functions, or store them in variables.
* You can also define a function inside another function, just as you can define an integer value inside a function. 
* And you can define functions without giving them a name, sprinkling your code with function literals as easily as you might write integer literals like 42.

2. The second main idea of functional programming is that the operations of a program should *map* input values to output values rather than change data in place.
* *Immutable* data structures are one of the cornerstones of functional programming.
* Another way of stating this second idea of functional programming is that methods should not have any *side effects*. They should communicate with their environment only by *taking arguments* and *returning results*.

#### Why Scala
In fact, almost all Scala code makes heavy use of Java libraries, often without programmers being aware of this fact.

* Scalaâ€™s _Ints_ are represented as Java primitive integers of type _int_ 
* _Floats_ are represented as _float_
* _Booleans_ as _boolean_
* Scala arrays are mapped to Java _arrays_. 
* Scala also re-uses many of the standard Java library types including _String_ and _Throwable_

Scala programs compile to *JVM bytecodes*. Their run-time performance is usually on par with Java programs.
Scala code can all Java methods, access Java field, Inherit from Java classes, and implement Java interface.

### First Step in Scala

##### variables
Scala has two kinds of variables, vals and vars.
1. A *val* is similar to a final variable in Java. Once initialized, a val can never be reassigned.
2. A *var*, by contrast, is similar to a non-final variable in Java. A var can be reassigned throughout its lifetime.
