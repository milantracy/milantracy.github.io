Hadoop File System was developed using distributed file system design. It is run on commodity hardware. Unlike other distributed systems, HDFS is highly *fault-tolerant* and designed using low-cost hardware.

HDFS follows the *master-slave* architecture

##### Namenode
The *namenode* is the commodity hardware that contains the GNU/Linux operating system and the namenode software. It is a software that can be run on commodity hardware. The system having the namenode acts as the *master server* and it does the following tasks:

* Manages the file system namespace.
* Regulates clientâ€™s access to files.
* It also executes file system operations such as renaming, closing, and opening files and directories.


##### Datanode
The *datanode* is a commodity hardware having the GNU/Linux operating system and datanode software. For every node in a cluster, there will be a datanode. These nodes manage the data storage of their system.

* Datanodes perform read-write operations on the file systems, as per client request.
* They also perform operations such as block creation, deletion, and replication according to the instructions of the namenode.


##### Block
Generally the user data is stored in the files of HDFS. The file in a file system will be divided into *one or more segments* and/or stored in individual data nodes. These file segments are called as *blocks*. In other words, the minimum amount of data that HDFS can read or write is called a Block. The default block size is *64MB*, but it can be increased as per the need to change in HDFS configuration.
