= Multithreading and Parallel Programming
:hp-tags: Java, Multithread

Multithreading enables multiple tasks in a program to be executed concurrently.
One of the powerful features of Java is its built-in support for _multithreading_â€”the concurrent running of multiple tasks within a program.

### Concept
A program may consist of many tasks that can run concurrently. 
A thread is the _flow of execution_, from beginning to end, of a task.

In _single-processor_ systems, the multiple threads share CPU time, known as _time sharing_, and the operating system is responsible for scheduling and allocating resources to them.


When your program executes as an application, the Java interpreter starts a thread for the *main* method. You can create additional threads to run concurrent tasks in the program. 

In Java, each task is an instance of the *Runnable* interface, also called a runnable object. A *thread* is essentially an object that facilitates the execution of a task.

### Creating Tasks and Threads
A task class must implement the *Runnable* interface. A task must be run from a thread.
