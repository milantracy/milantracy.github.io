= Multithreading and Parallel Programming
:hp-tags: Java, Multithread

Multithreading enables multiple tasks in a program to be executed concurrently.
One of the powerful features of Java is its built-in support for _multithreading_—the concurrent running of multiple tasks within a program.

### Concept
A program may consist of many tasks that can run concurrently. 
A thread is the _flow of execution_, from beginning to end, of a task.

In _single-processor_ systems, the multiple threads share CPU time, known as _time sharing_, and the operating system is responsible for scheduling and allocating resources to them.


When your program executes as an application, the Java interpreter starts a thread for the *main* method. You can create additional threads to run concurrent tasks in the program. 

In Java, each task is an instance of the *Runnable* interface, also called a runnable object. A *thread* is essentially an object that facilitates the execution of a task.

### Creating Tasks and Threads
A task class must implement the *Runnable* interface. A task must be run from a thread.

Runnalble interface only contains a method, *public abstract _run_()*.
A task must be executed in a thread. The *Thread* class contains the constructors for creating threads and many useful methods for controlling threads. 
Invoke the *_start_*() method to tell the JVM that the thread is ready to run
The JVM will execute the task by invoking the task’s *_run_*() method.

### Thread schedule

However, call *_start_* () doesn't mean that *_run_* () method would be called immeadiately, it means that the thread is available to *thread scheduler*, the order of execution depends on scheduler when the scheduler choose the thread to run among threads with the same priority. Only when the thread is choosen to run would the *_run_* () function be called.

### The Thread Class
The *Thread* class contains the constructors for creating threads for tasks and the
methods for controlling threads.

 Since the *_Thread_* class implements _Runnable_, you could define a class that extends Thread and implements the run method, and then create an object from the class and invoke its start method in a client program to start the thread
 
It mixes the task and the mechanism of running the task. Separating the task from the thread is a preferred design.
 
* *_yield_* () will release CPU time to other thread.
* *_sleep_* (long millis) method puts the thread to sleep for the specified time in mil- liseconds to allow other threads to execute. The method may throw a checked excetpion named *InterruptedException*

* *_join_* () method to force one thread to wait for another thread to finish
- _join_ () just forces the thread that start threads to wait until all threads that call join finish.
- the parent thread would stop at the line that calls _join_ (), waiting for the thread that calls join to finish, resume the parent thread.
- in one thread, all threads start in the thread would run in parallel, calling the join only blocks the thread that started them.
```java
Thread threa4 = new Thread(new Task());
for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++){
	if(i == 50) thread4.join();
    System.out.print(i);
}
```
In this case, number 50 to 99 will be printed *after thread 4 is finished*.
	


### Priority

Java assigns every thread a priority. By default, a thread inherits the priority of the thread that spawned it.

* *Priorities* are numbers ranging from 1 to 10. 
* The Thread class has the int constants *MIN_PRIORITY*, *NORM_PRIORITY*, and *MAX_PRIORITY*, representing 1, 5, and 10, respectively. 
* The priority of the *main* thread is *Thread.NORM_PRIORITY*.
* The JVM always picks the currently runnable thread with the *highest priority*.

You can increase or decrease the priority of any thread by using the *_setPriority_* method

you can get the thread’s priority by using the *_getPriority_* method.


A *lower-priority* thread can run only when no *higher-priority* threads are running. If all runnable threads have equal priorities, each is assigned an equal portion of the CPU time in a *circular queue*. This is called *_round-robin_* scheduling.

***
### Thread Pool
A *thread pool* can be used to execute tasks efficiently.

Starting a new thread for each task could limit _throughput_ and cause _poor performance_. Using a thread pool is an ideal way to manage the number of tasks executing concurrently. Java provides the *Executor* interface for executing tasks in a thread pool and the *ExecutorService* interface for managing and controlling tasks. ExecutorService is a subinterface of Executor.
