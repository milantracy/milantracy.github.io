:hp-tags: JSON

JSON stands for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation. JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data. JSON is an easier-to-use alternative to **XML**.

***
#### What is JSON?
* JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
* JSON is *language independent*
* JSON is *self-describing* and easy to understand
* The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.

***
#### Much _Like_ XML Because
* Both JSON and XML is *self describing*.
* Both JSON and XML is *hierarchical*
* Both JSON and XML can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages
* Both JSON and XML can be fetched with an *_XMLHttpRequest_*

#### Much _Unlike_ XML Because
* JSON doesn't use end tag
* JSON is shorter
* JSON is quicker to read and write
* JSON can *use arrays*
* XML has to be parsed with an *XML parser*, JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.

***

#### Why JSON?
For AJAX applications, JSON is faster and easier than XML:

Using *XML*

* Fetch an XML document
* Use the XML DOM to loop through the document
* Extract values and store in variables

Using *JSON*

* Fetch a JSON string
* JSON.Parse the JSON string


***
#### JSON Syntax Rules
JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax:

* Data is in *name/value* pairs
* JSON names require *double quotes.*
* Data is separated by commas
* *Curly braces* hold *objects*

`{"firstName":"Jing", "lastName":"Chen"}`

* *Square brackets* hold *arrays*

`[1,2,3,]`


*JSON values* can be:

* A number (integer or floating point)
* A string (in double quotes)
* A Boolean (true or false)
* An array (in square brackets)
* An object (in curly braces)
* null

***

#### JSON Files
* The file type for JSON files is ".json"
* The MIME type for JSON text is "application/json"
