= Python Static, Instance and Class
:hp-tags: Python

#### Static variable and Instance variable
Generally speaking, *instance variables* are unique to each instance and *class variables* are attributes and methods shared by instances of the class.
```
class Dog(object):
	
    kind = 'canine'		# class variable
    
    def __init__(self, name):
    	self.name = name		# instance variable

a = Dog('Ben')
b = Dod('Cam')
```

In the above code, vairiable _kind_ is class variable, it is shared by all instances of Dog class. a and b both have kind which is canine. Variable _name_ is instance variable, each instance of Dog keeps its own instance variable, unique to each other, for example, a's name is Ben and b's name is Cam.


Shared data like class variable can have possibly surprising effects with involving mutable objects such as lists and dictionaries.
