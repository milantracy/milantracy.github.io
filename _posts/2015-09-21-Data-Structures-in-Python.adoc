= Data Structures in Python
:hp-tags: python, data structure

There are four built-in data structures in Python - list, tuple, dictionary and set.

***
### List
A _list_ is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items


### Sequence
Lists, tuples and strings are examples of *sequences*, but what are sequences and what is so special about them?

The major features are *membership tests*, (i.e. the in and not in expressions) and *indexing operations*, which allow us to fetch a particular item in the sequence directly.


### Set
*Sets* are *unordered collections of simple objects*. These are used when the existence of an object in a collection is more important than the order or how many times it occurs.
