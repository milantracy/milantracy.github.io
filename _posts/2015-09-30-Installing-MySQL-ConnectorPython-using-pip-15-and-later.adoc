= Installing MySQL Connector/Python using pip 1.5 and later
:hp-tags: Python, MySQL, pip

The latest pip versions will fail on you when the packages it needs to install are not hosted on PyPI. When you try to install MySQL Connector/Python the usually way, you get following message is:

```shell
$ pip install mysql-connector-python
  Could not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement
    mysql-connector-python
  Some externally hosted files were ignored
    (use --allow-external mysql-connector-python to allow).
```

MySQL Connector/Python should now install using pip using following command:

```shell
$ pip install --allow-external mysql-connector-python mysql-connector-python
```
