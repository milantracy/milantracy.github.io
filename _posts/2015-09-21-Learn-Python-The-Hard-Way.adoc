= Learn Python The Hard Way
:hp-tags: Python, LPTHW

***
##### A Good First Program
* On the first line of each python script file, specify the python location starting with *#!
```python
#!/use/bin/python
```
* You may define the coding schema with:
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
```
***

##### Variables And Names
* variables may contain letters and digits and underscore, but a variable name could only start with letter and unserscore.

Every value has an *id*, which is a unique number related to where it is stored in the memory. The *id* of a variable is the id of the value the variable refers to.

***

##### Flow of execution

Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Statements are executed one at a time in order from top to bottom.

 Statements inside the function are not executed until the function is called. Is is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the first line of the called function, executeds all statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.
 
***
##### Print
* concatenate a string with formatters like '\s' and '\d' and a set of variables, the variables will replace the corresponding formatter.
```python
my_name = 'Jing'
print "Let's talk about %s." % my_name
```
* If you want multiple formats in your string to print multiple variables, you need to put them inside ( ) (parenthesis) separated by , (commas). 

***
##### Prompt
* *_raw_input_* () shows a prompt to a person so he knows what to type. 
* Difference between _input_() and _raw_input_()
- The _input_() function will try to convert things you enter as if they were Python code, but it has security problems so you should avoid it.


##### Function

The syntax for a function definition is
```python
def NAME(List of PARAMETERS):
  STATEMENTS
```
Reason for functions:

1. Creating a function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements. Functions can simplify a program by hiding a complex computation behind a single command.

2. Make program short by reducing repetitive code.

* Variables and parameters are local
- when you create a *local variable* inside a function, it only exists inside the function, and you cannot use it outside the function

A function that returns value is called *fruitful function*

* Before executes a function, we often to use build in function _isinstance_() to check type.
```python
isinstance(n, int)
# the function returns true if n is an integer
```
