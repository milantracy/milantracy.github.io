= Arraylist vs Vector in Java
:hp-tags: Java, Collections

1. Thread Safe
Vector is  synchronized while ArrayList is not synchronized. 
Synchronization and thread safe means at a time only one thread can access the code .In *Vector* class all the methods are synchronized .Thats why the Vector object is already synchronized when it is created.

2. Performance
Vector is slow as it is thread safe. In comparison ArrayList is fast as it is non synchronized.

3. Automatic Increasement
Java would check whether there is enough array to hold the new element, if not, java wouls create a new array whose capacity increases, and copy the elements from the old array to the new one.
* *Vector* doubles its size.
* *ArrayList* increases by 50% plus one.


4. Set size
*Vector* has _setSize_ () method to set the size of the current array while *ArrayList* doesn't.

5. Travesal
Other than Hashtable ,*Vector* is the only other class which uses both *Enumeration* and *Iterator* .
While *ArrayList* can only use Iterator for traversing an ArrayList .
