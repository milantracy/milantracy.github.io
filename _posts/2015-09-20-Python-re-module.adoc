= Python re module
:hp-tags: Python, regex

Regular expressions are a powerful language for matching text patterns. This page gives a basic introduction to regular expressions themselves sufficient for our Python exercises and shows how regular expressions work in Python. The Python "_re_" module provides regular expression support.

***
#### Basic pattern
* ordinary characters just match themselves exactly, including numbers and characters
* a period matches any single character except newline '\n'
* \t, \n, \r -- tab, newline, return
* ^ = start, $ = end -- match the start or end of the string
* \b matches the start or the end of the word
* \B matches the non-start nor non-end of the word
* \w matches a letter or a digit or a underscore
* \W matches non-letter nor non-digit nor underscore
* \s matches a single whitespace
* \S matches a non-whitespace
* \d matches a digit
* \D matches a non-digit
* repetition
- + 1 or more occurrences of the pattern to its left
- * 0 or more occurrences of the pattern to its left
- ? match 0 or 1 occurrences of the pattern to its left
- {n} matches exactly n occurrences of the pattern to its left
- {n,} matches at least n occurences of the pattern to its left
- {n, m} matches n to m occurences of the pattern to its left
- *lazy*, if above patterns are followed by ?, it means the pattern matches the string as small as possible.
* *Square bracket*
- square brackets can be used to indicate a set of chars
- a period just means a literal dot
- you can also use a dash to indicate a range, so [a-z] matches all lowercase letters.
* Branch
- a|b matches pattern a or pattern b
* *Group*
- the "group" feature of a regular expression allows you to pick out parts of the matching text.
- to do this, add parenthesis ( ) around the patterns which are supposed to be in a gtoup
- in this case, the parenthesis do not change what the pattern will match, instead they establish logical "groups" inside of the match text.
- result of group extraction is *1-based*, however, group 0 will be the whole match

In Python, the '*r*' at the start of the pattern string designates a python "raw" string which passes through backslashes without change which is very handy for regular expressions (Java needs this feature badly!).
 
***
#### Basic rule
* The search proceeds through the string from start to end, stopping at the *first match* found
* All of the pattern must be matched, but not all of the string
* *Leftmost & Largest*
- First the search finds the leftmost match for the pattern, and second it tries to use up as much of the string as possible

***
#### _re.search_ (pattern, str)
The __re.search()__ method takes a regular expression pattern and a string and searches for that pattern within the string. If the search is successful, _search()_ returns a match object or *None* otherwise.

Use _group()_ to return matched string
```python
import re
str = 'an example word:cat'
match = re.search(r'word:\w\w\w', str)
  if match:                      
    print 'found', match.group() 
  else:
    print 'did not find'
```
Output:
```
found word:cat
```

***
#### _re.match_ (pattern, str, [start position])
The _re.match_() method is similar to _re.search()_, however, _re.match()_ checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while _re.search()_ checks for a match anywhere in the string.
```python
import re

result1 = re.match("c","abcde");
if(result1):
    print("result1: "+result1.group());
else:
    print("nothing");

result2 = re.search("c","abcde");
if(result2):
    print("result2: "+result2.group());
```
Output:
```
nothing
result2: c
```

***
#### _re.split_ (pattern, string, maxsplit=0)
Split string by the occurrences of pattern. maxsplit defines the maximum fragment of result. By default, there is no limit.
```python
import re
re.split('\s+', 'chen jing    cj')
```
Output:
```
['chen', 'jing', 'cj']
```
***

#### _re.findall_ (pattern, string, flags=0)
_findall_() finds *all* the matches and returns them as *a list of strings*, with each string representing one match.

*findall and Groups*, if the pattern includes 2 or more parenthesis groups, then instead of returning a list of strings, findall() returns a list of *tuples*. Each tuple represents one match of the pattern, and inside the tuple is the group(1), group(2) .. data.
```python
import re
print re.findall('\d','1a2b3c4d')
print re.findall('(\d)(\w)', '1a2b3c4d')
```
Output:
```
['1', '2', '3', '4']
[('1', 'a'), ('2', 'b'), ('3', 'c'), ('4', 'd')]
```



***
#### _re.sub_ (pattern, replacement, str)
The _re.sub()_ function searches for all the instances of pattern in the given string, and replaces them. The replacement string can include '\1', '\2' which refer to the text from group(1), group(2), and so on from the original matching text.
```python
re.sub(r'\sAND\s', ' & ', 'Baked Beans And Spam', flags=re.IGNORECASE)
```
Output:
```
'Baked Beans & Spam'
```

```python
str = 'purple alice@google.com, blah monkey bob@abc.com blah dishwasher'
## \1 is group(1), \2 group(2) in the replacement
print re.sub(r'([\w\.-]+)@([\w\.-]+)', r'\1@yo-yo-dyne.com', str)
```
Output:
```
purple alice@yo-yo-dyne.com, blah monkey bob@yo-yo-dyne.com blah dishwasher
```

***
#### _re.purge_()
Clear the regular expression cache.

***
#### exception _re.error_
Exception raised when a string passed to one of the functions here is *not a valid regular expression* or when some other error occurs during compilation or matching. It is never an error if a string contains no match for a pattern.
